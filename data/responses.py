Welcome to the Character Builder, let me give you a description of how all this works:

This is a bot to build characters to FIGHT.  Each user is allowed one character, you can: 

%build: This triggers the character builder routine.

%view: View the character you've built.  

%tournament: This triggers the tournament functionality.

%reroll: This allows you to re-roll your character

%help: You already found this one obviously.

%delete: This deletes your character you.  No going back after this!

%pirate: Makes me talk like a pirate to you.

%cringe: Just don't, you'll regret it.
